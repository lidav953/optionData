# optionData

A simple options trading analysis tool that reads daily options trade data and outputs volume statistics and graphs.

### Usage

main.py is the primary program that uses data.py to analyze the data files.
data.py contains 3 classes that are used to read the data files, extract the relevant info, store any useful data, and output the desired statistics/graphs.

### Prerequisites

This version of the project is only able to read options data files that are already in the correct format. 
Examples of readable files are included in Options.zip.

### Motivation

After my equity analyst internship, I became interested in the link between programming and trading. I wanted to create a profitable trading strategy using historical data. This project was my first attempt at analyzing options data. The continuation is not included in this repository as I still use some strategies/analysis in my personal trading account today.
